# Virtual Spaces

## Ownership

Each player has the ability to simulate their own virtual space on their own computer.

- How much control, exactly, does a player have over their own space?
- What kinds of arbitrary rules (like laws of physics) can players impose onto their spaces, and what kinds of rules are innate in the system?
- Can a single player control multiple separate spaces on the same or different computers?
- How are spaces registered to the players that control them so that others can know, or are they?

## Connections

Spaces can be connected to one another in a seamless manner as one wider universe.

- How do connections between spaces get made?
- Is it necessarily consensual or can it be imposed?
- One-way or two-way?
- How are the connections shaped, exactly, and where are they naturally found?
- When is information about the world being connected to loaded?
- Is part of the world visible through the connection before crossing it?

## Size and Shape

- Infinite or finite? Can players choose which of these, or is it imposed?
- If finite, how is it shaped, and does it have borders?
- If it has borders, what happens at them? If not, how exactly does it wrap back upon itself?
- What, if any, limits are there on the sizes of finite worlds?
- If infinite, this means people who can afford more hardware may have larger worlds - is this unfair by the principle of meritocracy?
- If that is unfair, how can this unfairness be mitigated?

## Internal Organization

- Continuous or discrete?
- If discrete, what tiling or honeycomb is used to divide the space into units?
- Is that tiling fixed, changeable, or even dynamic and chaotic (i.e. not governed by any fixed group of symmetries)?
- What geometries are supported and how can they be selected or changed?
- What is the smallest unit of "space nodes" which can be connected in any ways to any others?

## Shared Spaces

Multiple players can share control of a single space.

- How does a shared space get set up?
- Who has control over a shared space?
- Are there completely public spaces that anyone can link to?
- Can control be wrested away or concentrated in some manner?
- Is management of a shared space democratic?
- How is such "theft" or "revolution" prevented if it is possible?
- Is a shared space simulated in a distributed manner across multiple computers or centered on one?
- If distributed, how does that work?

## Procedural Generation

Spaces are arranged and filled in a procedural manner to make the entire world network feel smooth and organic.

- What are the borders between the player-organized and the procedurally-generated portions of spaces?
- Are there procedural "wild" spaces intermediate between player-controlled ones?
- If so how are they arranged, and who simulates them?
- What degree of persistence is there in wild spaces?
- Can the procgen algorithms be changed, extended, or created by players?
- What if multiple players or entities want to inhabit the same wild space, how can they stay in consensus about its shape?

## Moderation

- How can players be protected from inappropriate activity or treatment inside spaces owned by others?
- How are they protected in shared spaces - is this up to the consensus of the owners to determine?
- Does player control over a private space extend to doing anything they want, or are there some hard and fast rules for fairness imposed by the system itself?
