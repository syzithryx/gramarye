# What is Gramarye?

Our goal is for Gramarye to be:

- an **open-source platform** for collaborative development of and interaction within **virtual spaces**...
- **augmenting and intertwining** with, but never replacing, the physical world...
- both **publicly accessible**, and **private** to specific groups or individuals...
- via **distributed computing** over a **peer-to-peer network**...
- secured by blockchain or similar **decentralized consensus** technologies...
- organized with panarchic and democratic confederalist models of **decentralized, bottom-up governance**...
- for the ultimate purpose of **empowering individuals, communities, and ecosystems**...
- by promoting **empathy, lovingkindness, and peace**...
- both among humans and **across species**...
- at once **locally** and **across the entire world**...
- by means of **collective creativity, educational gameplay, and nonviolent communication.**
