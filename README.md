## What is Gramarye?

To answer that question, one must answer another, seemingly unrelated question: "What would a perfect world be like?"

There are as many answers to that as there are people. But here's one possible choice, organized around eight Principles.

In a perfect world, every being would have absolute freedom to:

- **Ecology**: participate in a vibrant community of diverse beings coexisting harmoniously.
- **Inclusivity**: determine the shape of their own body and mind, living as their true self without shame.
- **Creativity**: design their environment however they will, fitting it to their unique personality.
- **Nonviolence**: do anything they want which is consensual and voluntary for every being affected.
- **Lovingkindness**: interact with other beings in a spirit of friendship, trust, and playfulness.
- **Meritocracy**: be recognized and appreciated for their true contributions to the welfare of others.
- **Security**: never be influenced against their will by any being or force.
- **Privacy**: control who has access to each piece of information about themselves.

Sadly, the real world does not often much resemble this perfect vision. But a virtual world can.

Our aim is to create such a virtual world, enacting these principles as fully as possible, with the ultimate purpose of interweaving with the real world, and eventually, transforming it from within into paradise worthy of its prototype in the dreams of humanity.

So, to complete the answer to the question we started with, Gramarye is:

- an **open-source platform** for collaborative development of and interaction within **virtual spaces**...
- **augmenting and intertwining** with, but never replacing, the physical world...
- both **publicly accessible**, and **private** to specific groups or individuals...
- using **distributed computing** over a **peer-to-peer network**...
- secured by technologies enabling **decentralized consensus**...
- organized with panarchic and democratic confederalist models of **bottom-up governance**...
- made for the ultimate purpose of **empowering individuals, communities, and ecosystems**...
- and promoting **empathy, lovingkindness, and peace across species**...
- by means of **collective creativity**, **educational gameplay**, and **nonviolent communication.**

Ambitious? Of course. What worthy endeavor isn't? Here's how we will do it. Each section to follow corresponds to a sub-project - one modular piece of the grand design.

## Virtual Spaces
### [The Node System](virtual spaces/node system.md)
Nodes as actors in the actor model (finite automata), with links as messaging contacts
### [Language of Magic](virtual spaces/language of magic.md)
Visual, flowchart-like system (similar to DRAKON) for intuitively managing the "AI" of nodes
### [Auto-Describer](virtual spaces/auto-describer.md)
Translates relationships among nodes into verbal descriptions in any language
### [Procedural Generation](virtual spaces/procedural generation.md)
AIs or other algorithms translating node structures into 2D or 3D images

## Interfaces
### [Accessibility](interfaces/accessibility.md)
Every system must be accessible to people with as many types of disabilities as possible
### [Augmented Reality](interfaces/augmented reality.md)
"Quests" to be performed in the real world for in-game rewards (such as merit)

## Distributed Computing
### [Scheduling](distributed computing/scheduling.md)
Turn-based activity unfolding in real time - a hybrid style of gameplay
### [Memory/Processing Trading](distributed computing/memory processing trading.md)
The main currency is used to rent memory or processor cycles, or modify nodes; it recharges based on merit

## Decentralized Consensus
### [Byzantine Reliable Broadcast](decentralized consensus/byzantine reliable broadcast.md)
A protocol which may soon replace blockchain (cutting edge research)
### [Egregores](decentralized consensus/egregores.md)
Leader entities controlled collectively by numerous players, mergers of hive mind and AI
### [Merit System](decentralized consensus/merit system.md)
Each player gets a few "merits" each day which can be donated at will; higher merit = more influence

## Nonviolent Ecology
### [Collective Creativity](nonviolent ecology/collective creativity.md)
Players design procgens, which design mutations, which are selected by players
